# Assignment **8**

Create pages that use VueJS to perform the CRUD operations that were earlier created using the ASP.NET Core MVC Framework. Also add some styling
to the website to add your own personal flare

- Fix up the navigation so that it isn't an unordered list of items. ✔
- Change up the theme a bit so that the default colors aren't used at a minimum for buttons and links. ✔
- Add the necessary resources to the package.json file so that vuejs applications can be transpiled correctly. ✔❌
- Configure webpack to transpile the vuejs files. ✔❌
- Modify the app.ts file so that you can create/update/delete/fetch the users, gifts, and groups. ✔❌
- Remove the ListGifts functionality and replace the index page in each of the Gifts, Users, Groups views so that you can perform all the CRUD features
